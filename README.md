## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)


### What I learned

This has been my first time to try out tailwindCSS for styling the components. My key takeaway is to learn as you build the site to have a more fruitful way of learning.


### Continued development

Would like to improve the testimonials part as a carousel component in the future.


### Useful resources

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - The documentation greatly helped me understand and navigate to which utilities I could use for styling and structuring the landing page.
